"""A wrong WorkspaceName must fail before anything is created.

With DeployNewWorkspace=false and a
WorkspaceName that does not exist, this template used to create the checkpoint storage account, the user-assigned identity and the App Service Plan
and only then fail with ResourceNotFound. Depending on the workspace resource did not help:
ARM counts a resource whose `condition` is false as a satisfied dependency, so the
dependency graph protected nothing exactly where it looked like it did.

A `precheck-workspace-exists` nested deployment resolves the workspace with reference()
before anything else runs, and every other resource waits on it. Measured in Incidents, where
this was found on a live customer deploy: five resources became zero.

These checks pin the guard's shape, because a guard that cannot fail is not a guard:
  * inner expression evaluation -- with `outer`, reference() resolves in the parent scope
    and the guard succeeds whether the workspace exists or not
  * an actual reference() to the workspace -- without it the guard always succeeds
  * gated on the create toggle -- otherwise it looks for a workspace it is about to create
  * every other resource waits on it -- otherwise they are created before it fails
